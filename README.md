# DefectDetection
Using image recognition and deep learning methods to identify defects in manufactured items
# Background
Manufacturing plants carry out defect checks manually. The phase in the production process at which manufactured items are evaluated for defects, may differ for items. However, they are all performed manually. The problem with this method of checking defects lies in human error. According to a study, 20% of defects went unreported due to human error. Human error can have detrimental impacts on industries. 

For example, if a manufacturing company manufactures steel sheets, which are used in the construction industry, produces steel sheets with defects, it will have huge impacts on the companies buying those sheets to construct buildings. Manual checks for defects are not guaranteed and efficient. The cost of hiring a workforce, responsible for quality checks continues to rise, without the guarantee of defect free products.

Defects that go unnoticed result in another issue, recalls. Recalls occur when a defective batch of item is shipped to customers and have to be taken back from customers due to the presence of defects. Takata Corporation, an automotive parts manufacturer, reported an approximate value of USD 7billion to USD 24 billion in recalls from defects.
